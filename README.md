How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two.
Encapsulation is key to creating an adaptable and maintanable program, so that it is fairly easy to "plug-in" modules into different programs.  Following the PEP standards is what makes code easy to read, consistently, no matter who is looking at the code.

What were the advantages of working in this way?
Following industry best standards now while in the beginning of my career will help tremendously in the future, also these standards were created after many hours and years of trial and error from other programmers.  

How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I actually want to create new programs in the future that deal with different databases, and I can expand this module to become more encapsulated and therefore more versatile.
